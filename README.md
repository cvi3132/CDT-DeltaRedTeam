 Tools to be used in Comp 3
 
 How to use tools:
 1) Plant script in the /opt directory on target machine
 2) Run Ansible script with host equaling target machine's IP address
 3) After that the terminal on the target machine will close every three minutes
    and if it is disabled, the cronjob will run the script again in 30 minutes
